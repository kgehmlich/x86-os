# x86-os
x86 Operating System - A learning project

A personal project to build an x86 OS from scratch. Feel free to use any of this code for your own (non-commercial) projects, but for the time being I will not be merging any pull requests, as this is mainly intended to be a learning experience.

---------------------------------

Assembly command

All .asm files should be assembled using the following nasm command, unless otherwise noted in the source code:

nasm [infile.asm] -f bin -o [outfile.bin]
